                <h3>Our First Mission: The 7-7-7 Initiative</h3>
                <p>A vision is only as powerful as the action it inspires. Our first mission is a direct, tangible plan to plant 14 seeds of change across Nepal, creating living proof that a better world is possible.</p>
                <p>The plan is simple and profound:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>We will partner with <strong>7 brave families</strong> and <strong>7 forward-thinking orphanages</strong>.</li>
                    <li>We will establish these 14 "Hunateculture Hubs" across the <strong>7 provinces of Nepal</strong>.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Over five years, I and my team will guide each hub through a complete life redesign using the principles of Hunateculture. They will become lighthouses in their communities—fully self-reliant in their food, health, and energy, and serving as real-world classrooms for others to learn from. This is not charity; this is an investment in human potential and ecological regeneration.</p>

                <p>This work is too big for one person. It requires a dedicated family of visionaries, builders, and guardians. The movement is structured around a core team that embodies the multi-skilled, self-reliant spirit of the Hunatian.</p>

                <p>Before one can join the core work, one must do the inner work. I have designed "Becoming Hunatian," a free, 3-month public course for anyone who wants to begin this journey of self-transformation.</p>
                <p>It is a path to unlearn the conditioning of the failing system and to reclaim your own health, purpose, and inner wisdom. This is the foundation upon which all our external work is built.</p>
