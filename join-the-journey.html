                <h3>The Call for Life Designers: Become a Hunate Engineer</h3>
                <p>This is a call to the young visionaries, the multi-skilled builders, and the courageous hearts ready to dedicate their lives to a new way of being. A Hunate Engineer is not a job title; it is a sacred responsibility to co-create the blueprint for a regenerative future.</p>
                <p><strong>Who We Seek:</strong> We are looking for individuals under 30 with a deep passion, a humble spirit, and expertise in one of our 13 core domains. You must be a self-starter, a deep thinker, and ready to commit to a journey of intense learning and service.</p>
                <p><strong>The Path:</strong> The selection process is a journey of mutual discovery, involving a detailed application, a first assignment to test your vision, and a final alignment dialogue. This is not for everyone; it is for the truly called.</p>

                <h3>The Call for Wisdom Keepers: Become a Hunate Mentor</h3>
                <p>A new generation's energy must be guided by the embodied wisdom of its elders. We are seeking a council of respected leaders and experts to serve as the ethical compass and strategic guardians of our movement. This is not a role of management, but of sacred guidance.</p>
                <p><strong>Who We Seek:</strong> Esteemed professionals and practitioners in our core domains who feel a deep responsibility to pass on their life's learnings. Your role is high-impact, requiring only a few hours a month.</p>
                <p><strong>The Path:</strong> Our engagement begins with a respectful dialogue to ensure philosophical alignment, followed by an in-person meeting to formalize the partnership. This is an invitation to shape a legacy.</p>

                <p>We are seeking 14 courageous partners—7 families and 7 orphanages—to embark on a profound, multi-year journey of transformation. Your home and land will become a living example of a self-sufficient, regenerative way of life for your entire community.</p>
                <p><strong>Who We Seek:</strong> Partners with secure land access, a deep desire for self-reliance, a willingness to work hard, and an open heart to learn and share. You will be the living proof that a new world is possible.</p>
                <p><strong>The Path:</strong> A careful selection process involving a detailed application, a site visit, an in-depth interview, and a final decision by our Weighted Council ensures a deep and lasting partnership.</p>

                <p>This is an invitation to get your hands in the soil. We are looking for passionate individuals to join us on the ground for a minimum of 3 months. This is not voluntourism; it is a deep dive into community living, hard work, and the practical application of Hunateculture.</p>
                <p><strong>Who We Seek:</strong> Resilient, adaptable individuals with practical skills (in farming, building, teaching, or media) and a spirit of service. You must be ready for simple living and a profound, life-changing experience.</p>
                <p><strong>The Path:</strong> An application followed by an alignment interview to ensure your expectations and skills are a good fit for the needs of our hubs.</p>

                <p><strong>Who We Seek:</strong> Individuals with deep, respected roots in their community, excellent communication skills, and a profound understanding of the local culture. Your integrity is your most important qualification.</p>
