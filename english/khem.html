                    <h2>Chapter I: The Roots (1991-2005)</h2>
                    <p>I was born on November 13, 1991, in Bastim, a remote village in Bhojpur, Nepal. My story begins with my parents, rebels in their own right. My father, from a Newar family, and my mother, from a Brahmin family, defied the caste norms of their time, running away to marry with the support of their fellow communist party members. They were activists, social workers who built schools and brought water taps to villages that had none. Their spirit of questioning and serving was the world I was born into.</p>
                    <p>My earliest memories are of a life lived close to the earth, a life with grandparents and a large joint family after my parents‚Äô own union was fractured by betrayal. I was a wild child, loved by everyone but lacking the focused guidance of a mother and father. I remember my first conscious memory: waking up alone in a dark room, crawling towards a sliver of light to find the entire village celebrating a festival in our home. A journey from fear and darkness into light and community. Perhaps that moment was a premonition for my entire life.</p>
                    <p>Moving to Damak flipped my world. The city was a sensory explosion of bicycles, buses, and electricity. But it was also a place of struggle. I learned early lessons in these years. A leech bite during a rice plantation taught me not to panic but to act. An ant bite on my brother taught me to be brave when no one else was around. But the most profound lessons were often painful. A teacher locked me in a dark room for not doing homework, instilling a fear of authority that would take years to heal. I learned about embarrassment when I had to take a piece of cardboard to an exam while my friends had proper clipboards. And I learned about the darkness within society when I was exposed to sexuality not through guidance, but through confusing and shameful encounters that would silence my ability to connect for over a decade.</p>

                    <h2>Chapter II: The Descent (2005-2011)</h2>
                    <p>My parents, struggling with their own broken trust and the pressures of a failing revolution, sent me to a hostel. It was a big, reputable place, but for me, it became a world of stark contrasts. I was surrounded by the sons of wealthy British Army families who had everything‚Äîtoys, gadgets, stories of travel. I had nothing. That feeling of scarcity, of being an outsider, planted deep seeds of jealousy and confusion.</p>
                    <blockquote>"I used to wonder why they had everything. My parents worked day and night, too. But still, how? I was jealous. At some point, I started blaming my parents for not having much, but the thing is, I could not share these things with them. I couldn't ask anyone."</blockquote>
                    <p>The hostel was a microcosm of a broken world. The days were filled with study, sports, and friendship, but the nights were a secret darkness. Seniors preyed on the young. Bullying was rampant. I was forced into sexual acts against my will. To survive, I had to adapt. The boy who was once a victim learned to become a bully, a liar, a thief. I became everything I hated, playing a role during the day and another at night. It was a game of survival, and it was eroding my soul.</p>
                    <p>When the hostel closed and I returned home, the outside world felt bigger, but I was more lost than ever. I started stealing money from my parents, buying perfumes and clothes to fill the emptiness. I got into fights, smoked, drank, and eventually found my way to heroin. My family was collapsing under the weight of financial ruin and my parents' separation. One friend in our circle died of an overdose, and I, along with five others, ended up in jail. My parents didn't even come to see me. They sent a message: "You are better there." That broke me. I wanted to change, but the addiction had its claws in me.</p>

                    <h2>Chapter III: The Awakening (2012-2016)</h2>
                    <p>My life was a spiral. I quit school, believing it was pointless. I worked odd jobs‚Äîin a call center, as a waiter in a five-star hotel‚Äîbut felt a deep disgust for a system that valued profit over people. I saw so much wasted food, so much fake politeness. I quit everything. I decided not to work for money anymore. It was a radical decision born of despair.</p>
                    <p>The true turning point came after a painful breakup. Lost and heartbroken, I finally went to a Vipassana meditation course. For ten days, in silence, I was forced to confront the storm inside me. The anger, the trauma, the pain‚Äîit all came pouring out. I spent an entire session consumed with rage, plotting revenge against a man who had wronged my family. And then, on the fourth day, something broke. Staring at a sunset, a gentle wind blew, and tears began to stream down my face. It was not a cry of sorrow, but of release. I felt my body dissolve into nature. I forgave everyone, including myself. I accepted my past not as a series of mistakes, but as the necessary path that had led me to that moment.</p>
                    <blockquote>"That moment, I changed. Something inside me changed. It touched my soul. I forgot about blaming and complaining. I accepted everything as it is. I detached events and emotions. And that was it."</blockquote>
                    <p>After Vipassana, my journey truly began. I started working on my mom's truck, transporting lumber across Nepal. Life on the road was my new classroom. I saw the country, the corruption, the prostitution, the simple kindness of strangers. I traveled to Haridwar, India, seeking wisdom at Patanjali Yogpeeth. I hitchhiked through the hills, sleeping in a stranger's hut one night and a police station the next. I was learning more about life, resilience, and human nature than any school could ever teach me.</p>

                <section>
                    <h2>Chapter IV: The Path of Service (2016-2023)</h2>
                    <p>My travels led me to Maya Universe Academy, a volunteer-run school in a remote village. Here, I found a place to apply my lessons. I started as a volunteer, teaching yoga and science, and eventually became the school principal. It was here that I learned to heal my own wounds. I learned to dance with the children, to sing in front of crowds, to lead not with authority, but with love and friendship. I met people from all over the world‚Äîvolunteers from Germany, China, America. I fell in love, had my heart broken, and learned to love again without possession.</p>
                    <p>This period was about synthesis. In 2015, I had presented the first draft of my ideas, then called "The Joon Project," to a circle of friends in Kathmandu. Now, with years of real-world experience, the vision became clearer. The COVID-19 pandemic was another catalyst. While the world froze in fear, we‚Äîa small group of friends‚Äîstarted building a hut on our family farm. It was a tangible act of hope, a decision to create our own system when the old one was so clearly failing.</p>
                    <p>The Joon Project grew. We worked with a local orphanage, not as charity workers, but as family. We introduced yoga, meditation, and art. We gave the children roles and responsibilities, teaching them to manage their own home. We organized festivals without money, built shelters from bamboo, and proved that community is built on contribution, not currency. This was the laboratory where the principles of Hunate were tested and refined.</p>

                <section>
                    <h2>Chapter V: The Hunate Movement (2023-Present)</h2>
                    <p>The journey has not been without its pauses. A family crisis in 2023, when my partner's father had a severe accident, forced me to halt the project. It was a difficult time that required all my energy and presence. But even this pause was a lesson. It taught me about devotion, about showing up when it matters most, and it gave me the space to reflect, document, and refine everything I had learned.</p>
                    <p>From that period of deep reflection, The Joon Project was reborn as the **Hunate Movement**. It is the culmination of everything‚Äîthe pain, the healing, the travels, the failures, and the successes. It is no longer just my story; it is an invitation for everyone to begin their own journey of self-discovery and to co-create a future where humans, nature, and technology can live in harmony.</p>
                    <p>This website, this movement, is the next chapter. It is the story I am still writing, and I invite you to be a part of it. Your support, your curiosity, and your own courage to change are what will give this story its true meaning.</p>
