                    <h3>An Inheritance of Rebellion</h3>
                    <p>My story begins before I was born, in the hills of Bhojpur. My father, a Pradhan from the Newar caste, and my mother, a Parajuli from the Brahmin caste, fell in love across the rigid lines of a society that forbade their union. Their love was an act of rebellion, and their inter-caste marriage resulted in their exile. With nothing but each other, they fled to the plains of Damak to build a new life from scratch. It was here, in 1991, that I was born into a world of constant struggle and profound love. We moved from one rented room to another, my father working every job imaginable while my mother held our world together. My first memories are not of wealth, but of a home rich with books and music—an oasis of warmth in a landscape of poverty. This foundation was shattered when my family broke apart, a casualty of cheating. It was my first, intimate lesson in how a system—even one as small as a family—can fail when its core principles are compromised. I saw the pain of betrayal, and a seed was planted: a deep need to understand how to build systems based on unwavering trust.</p>

                    <h3>The Wilderness Years</h3>
                    <p>The breakup cast me into a wilderness. I spent years as a child without my parents, eventually living in a hostel, a world away from home. This was a time of deep loneliness, but also of fierce independence. I learned to navigate the world on my own terms. My parents, caught in the currents of the Maoist Civil War, faced their own trials, including time in jail. Their fight for a different political system mirrored my own internal fight for a different way of being. It was during this time that I moved back to Damak to live with my mother and brother. I remember the fear of learning to cross the busy road alone—a small victory that felt monumental. I also remember the pride of walking through our village in the pitch dark, holding a lamp while my mother and brother taught our neighbors how to read and write. We were bringing light to the darkness, a lesson that would become a guiding principle for my life's work. It was a time of harsh lessons in trust, false accusations, and the cruelty of social systems, but also a time where the seeds of service were nurtured.</p>

                    <h3>The Crucible of Youth</h3>
                    <p>Adolescence was a crucible. The confusion of lust, the deep bonds of friendship, the trauma of abuse, and a painful descent into addiction marked these years. It was a period of deconstruction, of tearing down the identity that society, trauma, and expectation had built for me. The healing process was slow and arduous, but it was in this underworld of my own making that I found a deeper strength. It taught me compassion, not as an abstract ideal, but as a felt reality for anyone who is suffering. It was a necessary fire that burned away the inessential, leaving behind a profound desire to create environments where others would not have to suffer in the same way. It was the understanding that a system that produces so much pain in its young people is a system that is fundamentally, catastrophically failing.</p>

                    <blockquote>"My real education began the day I left the classroom. I had to unlearn everything to discover what was true, and the world itself became my university."</blockquote>

                    <h3>The University of Life</h3>
                    <p>With a foundation of raw experience, I dropped out of the formal education system and enrolled in the University of Life. My curriculum was the world itself. I traveled across Nepal and India, not as a student of humanity, but as a student of humanity, often staying in the homes of complete strangers who taught me more than any textbook could. My professional life was a deliberate, sprawling exploration of the system from the inside. I wasn't just working jobs; I was conducting field research. I served guests in 5-star resorts, sold websites in a high-pressure US-based call center, managed logistics for a transport company, and worked with my hands on farms and in lumber yards. Each job was a case study in a different facet of the failing system—its hierarchies, its values, its impact on the human spirit. This worldly education was balanced by a deep, inward journey. I immersed myself in Vipassana meditation, learning to observe reality with equanimity. I studied yoga and Patanjali's sutras, connecting with ancient wisdom. My life was further enriched by relationships with lovers from around the world, each one a lesson in culture, communication, and the universal language of the human heart.</p>

                    <h3>Forged in Service</h3>
                    <p>All these threads—the inherited rebellion, the pain of a broken family, the lessons of the road, the discipline of meditation, and the insights from a dozen different industries—finally came together in an act of service. I joined Maya Universe Academy, a free private school in Tanahun, first as a volunteer and later becoming the school principal. Here, I saw the alternative in action. I saw a community built on trust, a learning environment that nurtured creativity, and a system that valued contribution over currency. It was in serving these children and this community that the personal journey became a universal blueprint. The abstract ideas forged in solitude and tested on the road were now given form. The pain of the past was transmuted into a purpose for the future. It was here that the name was born for this new way of seeing, of building, of living. It was the birth of the Hunate Project.</p>
