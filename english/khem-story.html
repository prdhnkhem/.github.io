                        <h3>An Inheritance of Rebellion</h3>
                        <p>My story begins before I was born, in the hills of Bhojpur, an act of rebellion. My father, a Pradhan from the Newar caste, and my mother, a Parajuli from the Brahmin caste, fell in love across the rigid lines of a society that forbade their union. Their inter-caste marriage was a revolution, and it resulted in their exile. With nothing, they fled to the plains of Damak to build a new life. It was here, in 1991, that I was born—not in a hospital, but in an animal shelter, a fitting start for a life that would be lived outside conventional walls.</p>
                        <p>Our life was one of constant struggle and profound love. We moved from one rented room to another. My first memory is of a dark room, just a single bed for three, and the incredible feeling of love and safety. But this foundation was shattered by cheating, and my family broke apart. It was my first, intimate lesson in how a system—even one as small as a family—can fail when its core principles are compromised.</p>

                        <h3>The Formative Years</h3>
                        <p>I moved to Damak to live with my mother and brother. I remember the primal fear of a leech attack while playing in the mud, and the pure joy of the Holi festival. I remember walking through our village in the pitch dark, holding a lamp while my mother and brother taught our neighbors how to read and write—we were bringing light to the darkness. And I remember the daily terror of the walk home from school, a path that led through a lonely jungle. I learned to run, to face my fear, and to find my way home. It was a time of harsh lessons, but also a time where the seeds of service and resilience were planted.</p>
                        
                        <blockquote>"I was a quiet, shy kid, an observer. I saw everything. The pain, the joy, the hypocrisy. The world was my first teacher."</blockquote>

                        <h3>The Wilderness of Hostel Life</h3>
                        <p>The family breakup cast me into the wilderness of hostel life in Kathmandu. It was a brutal world of hierarchies, bullying, and survival of the fittest. There were gang wars fought over scraps of respect, and I was abused by seniors. But it was also a place of intense camaraderie. I found my tribe, my brothers in survival. We learned to fight, to protect each other, to navigate a system that was often cruel and uncaring. It was a tough, painful education, but it taught me about power, loyalty, and the deep human need for a tribe. It forged an independence in me that would become the engine for my life's journey.</p>

                    <h3>The University of Life</h3>
                    <p>My real education began the day I left the classroom. I was suspended, I fought with my parents, and I knew the conventional path was a dead end for me. I enrolled in the University of Life, and the world became my curriculum. My "jobs" were my fieldwork. I served the wealthy in a 5-star resort and sold websites in a high-pressure US call center. I managed logistics for a transport company and worked with my hands on farms. Each job was a case study in a different facet of the failing system. But the most profound education came from the road. I hitchhiked to Haridwar, India, seeking spiritual truth. I immersed myself in Vipassana meditation and the wisdom of Patanjali's Yoga Sutras. I fell in love with an American volunteer, a relationship that taught me about culture, connection, and the universal language of the heart.</p>

                        <h3>The Synthesis: Forged in Service</h3>
                        <p>All these threads—the inherited rebellion, the pain of a broken family, the lessons of the hostel, the wisdom of the road, and the discipline of meditation—finally came together in an act of service. I joined Maya Universe Academy, a free private school, first as a volunteer. Here, I saw an alternative in action: a community built on trust, a learning environment that nurtured creativity, and a system that valued contribution over currency. I poured my heart into the work and eventually became the school principal. It was in serving these children and this community that the personal journey became a universal blueprint. The abstract ideas forged in solitude were now given form. The pain of the past was transmuted into a purpose for the future. It was here that the name was born for this new way of seeing, of building, of living. It was the birth of the Hunate Project.</p>
