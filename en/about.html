                    <p class="about__description">
                        [cite_start]My life has been a journey of questioning, exploring, and seeking truth amidst failing systems[cite: 215]. [cite_start]Born in a remote village in Bhojpur, my path led me through the confines of hostel life, the chaos of a nation in civil war, and the personal struggles of addiction and loss[cite: 604, 645, 671, 716]. [cite_start]By the time I was in my early twenties, I had failed in the British Army trials, dropped out of multiple colleges, and felt profoundly disconnected from the world's definition of success[cite: 707, 718].
                    </p>
                    <p class="about__description">
                        This period of being lost was also a period of awakening. [cite_start]It pushed me to travel, to learn from the road, to volunteer, and to seek wisdom in ancient practices like Yoga and Vipassana meditation[cite: 771, 767]. [cite_start]It was through this process of deep self-reflection and hands-on experience that the seeds of the Hunate Movement were sown[cite: 744].

                                    [cite_start]<p>I was born into a family of rebels, the union of a Brahmin mother and a Newar father, both communist revolutionaries in a time when inter-caste marriage was forbidden[cite: 600, 601]. [cite_start]My life began in an animal shelter in Bhojpur, a place without roads or electricity, and was immediately shaped by turmoil[cite: 604]. [cite_start]A family betrayal led to my mother leaving for the city of Damak with my newborn brother, while I was left behind with my grandmother[cite: 607]. [cite_start]My earliest memories are of this separation, of navigating a world of adults alone, culminating in a terrifying solo journey from a dark room towards a distant celebration—a journey from darkness to light that still shapes me[cite: 609, 610].</p>
                                    <p>My childhood was a series of jarring transitions. [cite_start]I was moved to Damak, a modern city that was a world away from my village, and soon after sent to a hostel[cite: 613, 638]. Hostel life was a brutal education in survival. [cite_start]By day, I was a good student and athlete, but by night, I faced a world of bullying, abuse, and exploitation[cite: 647]. I learned to be a fighter, a protector for my younger brother, and a chameleon who adapted to a harsh environment. [cite_start]It was here, surrounded by the children of wealthy families, that I first felt the sting of inequality and began to question the systems that create such divides[cite: 646].</p>
                                    <p>The Maoist Civil War intensified these feelings. [cite_start]My parents were jailed for their revolutionary activities, our family was torn apart, and a beloved cousin was killed[cite: 672, 674]. [cite_start]I witnessed violence firsthand—a shooting in front of our shop, a near-death bus accident, and the constant threat of conflict[cite: 671, 663]. These experiences, combined with a feeling of being an outcast at school, pushed me further to the fringes. [cite_start]After leaving the hostel, I fell into a cycle of drug addiction, theft, and aimlessness[cite: 712]. [cite_start]My grades plummeted, and I was eventually suspended from school[cite: 696].</p>
                                    [cite_start]<p>The turning point came after a friend died of a drug overdose, an event that landed me and my friends in jail[cite: 716]. Facing the profound disappointment of my parents and the stark reality of my path, I knew I had to change. [cite_start]This began my conscious "Journey of Self-Discovery"[cite: 215]. [cite_start]I immersed myself in Vipassana meditation, which provided a path to heal from years of trauma[cite: 767]. I started traveling, not as a tourist, but as a seeker. [cite_start]I worked on trucks, hitchhiked across Nepal and India, and volunteered at an alternative school, Maya Universe Academy, where I finally found a community that valued hands-on learning and global connection[cite: 771, 785]. [cite_start]It was during this period, from roughly 2013 onwards, that I synthesized my life experiences with conspiracy theories, alternative economics (like The Venus Project), and ancient wisdom to form the foundation of "The Joon Project," the precursor to HUNATE[cite: 743, 215]. This project was my answer to the question that had haunted me my whole life: in a world of failing systems, how can we build a new way to live? The journey of pain had finally transformed into a journey of purpose.</p>

Our human-made systems—in health, education, economics, and governance—are broken, leading to disconnection and destruction.
