                <p><strong>My life has been a journey of questioning and seeking truth amidst failing systems.</strong> Born in a remote village, my path led me through the confines of hostel life, the chaos of a nation in civil war, and personal struggles of addiction and loss. This period of being lost was also a period of awakening. It pushed me to travel, to learn from the road, and to seek wisdom in ancient practices. It was through this process of deep self-reflection that the seeds of the Hunate Project were sown.</p>

                            <div class="accordion__description">
                                <p>I was born into a family of rebels, the union of a Brahmin mother and a Newar father, both communist revolutionaries in a time when inter-caste marriage was forbidden. My life began in an animal shelter in Bhojpur, a place without roads or electricity, and was immediately shaped by turmoil. A family betrayal led to my mother leaving for the city of Damak with my newborn brother, while I was left behind with my grandmother. My earliest memories are of this separation, of navigating a world of adults alone, culminating in a terrifying solo journey from a dark room towards a distant celebration—a journey from darkness to light that still shapes me.</p>
                                <p>My childhood was a series of jarring transitions. I was moved to Damak, a modern city that was a world away from my village, and soon after sent to a hostel. Hostel life was a brutal education in survival. By day, I was a good student and athlete, but by night, I faced a world of bullying, abuse, and exploitation. I learned to be a fighter, a protector for my younger brother, and a chameleon who adapted to a harsh environment. It was here, surrounded by the children of wealthy families, that I first felt the sting of inequality and began to question the systems that create such divides.</p>
                                <p>The Maoist Civil War intensified these feelings. My parents were jailed for their revolutionary activities, our family was torn apart, and a beloved cousin was killed. I witnessed violence firsthand—a shooting in front of our shop, a near-death bus accident, and the constant threat of conflict. These experiences, combined with a feeling of being an outcast at school, pushed me further to the fringes. After leaving the hostel, I fell into a cycle of drug addiction, theft, and aimlessness. My grades plummeted, and I was eventually suspended from school.</p>
                                <p>The turning point came after a friend died of a drug overdose, an event that landed me and my friends in jail. Facing the profound disappointment of my parents and the stark reality of my path, I knew I had to change. This began my conscious "Journey of Self-Discovery". I immersed myself in Vipassana meditation, which provided a path to heal from years of trauma. I started traveling, not as a tourist, but as a seeker. I worked on trucks, hitchhiked across Nepal and India, and volunteered at an alternative school, Maya Universe Academy, where I finally found a community that valued hands-on learning and global connection. It was during this period, from roughly 2013 onwards, that I synthesized my life experiences with conspiracy theories, alternative economics (like The Venus Project), and ancient wisdom to form the foundation of "The Joon Project," the precursor to HUNATE. This project was my answer to the question that had haunted me my whole life: in a world of failing systems, how can we build a new way to live? The journey of pain had finally transformed into a journey of purpose.</p>

                 <h3>The Joon Project & Phases</h3>
                <p>"The Joon Project" (2013-2023) was the first practical experiment born from my personal journey. "Joon" means "Moon" in Nepali, symbolizing a fresh start, like a new civilization built from scratch, away from the influence of Earth's failing systems. We created an international hub for like-minded people to share ideas, skills, and cultures. During the COVID-19 pandemic, we built a physical platform in Damak, working with local youths, artists, and an orphanage. We built shelters, water systems, and organic toilets with our own hands. We hosted workshops, free music sessions, and even a camp festival without relying on money, politics, or NGOs. It was a raw, beautiful, and powerful experiment in what a community can achieve with shared intention. While the project eventually halted due to unforeseen family crises, its lessons became the direct foundation for the more refined and strategic vision of HUNATE.</p>
                <h3>Mission & Vision</h3>
                <p><strong>Our Mission</strong> is to explore, understand, and reveal new systems of living that fundamentally heal the disconnections between humans and their true nature; between nature and its sacred place in our lives; and between technology and its purpose to serve life.</p>
                <p><strong>Our Vision</strong> is a world where every child is born with the birthright of fresh air, clean water, and nourishing food. A future where humanity acts as one interconnected family, using technology to equitably share resources and build a healthier, smarter, and more abundant world for all generations.</p>

                    We see a world in crisis, built upon a profit-based economy that creates scarcity, greed, hunger, and fear. Our human-made systems—in health, education, economics, and governance—are broken, leading to disconnection and destruction. This is a call to notice what is happening and start reflecting.

Our leaders often prioritize short-term power over long-term well-being, and our legal systems protect the powerful rather than delivering true justice.
