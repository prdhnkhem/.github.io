            <h3>The Legacy of Rebels</h3>
            <p>
                My story begins before I was born, in the hills of Bhojpur, with my parents. My father, from a Newar family, and my mother, from a Brahmin family, decided to marry against the rigid caste structures of the time. Their union was not just one of love, but an act of revolution. Both were deeply involved in the communist movement, traveling from village to village, spreading a message of change and equality. They built schools and water systems, teaching and working for the community.
            </p>
            <blockquote class="pull-quote">
                "This whole journey of my parents, questioning, and exploring new ways to life was engraved in their whole presence... And that's where I was born with their union."
            </blockquote>

            <h3>A Childhood in the Village</h3>
            <p>
                I was born on November 13th in an animal shelter in Bastim, a common practice in a time and place where life was raw and deeply connected to the earth. My grandmother, a strong and respected leader in our village, was the house administrator. Yet, this stability shattered when a rumor about my father led to a second wife entering our family. The trust was broken. My mother, with my newborn brother on her back, left for the city of Damak, leaving me behind in the care of my grandparents. I grew up wild and free, without the direct guidance of my parents.
            </p>
            <p>
                My first true memory is of waking up alone in a dark room, drawn by the distant sound of celebration. I crawled from my bed, down the wooden stairs, and toward the light of the main door, my vision blurred by tears. There, I saw my entire community—dancing, singing, celebrating together. That journey from darkness to light became a metaphor for my life.
            </p>

            <h3>The Shock of a New World</h3>
            <p>
                Eventually, my mother called for me. The journey to Damak was a violent transition from my known world. I remember being dragged, crying, not wanting to leave my home. Then came the shock of the airport—the sight of an airplane, a marvel of technology I couldn't comprehend, and the strange, clean beauty of the air hostesses who seemed like beings from another world. Damak was a different universe of concrete, bicycles, and electricity. My four-year-old world had flipped, and I was a wild spirit trying to make sense of it all.
            </p>

            <h3>Forged in the Hostel's Fire</h3>
            <p>
                After a brief period with my reunited family, my parents found me too difficult to handle and sent me to Peace Land Hostel. For the next eleven years, this institution became my world. It was a place of deep contradictions. I was surrounded by the children of wealthy British Army officers, with their toys and stories of vacations, which filled me with a sense of lack and jealousy.
            </p>
            <p>
                The days were filled with school, sports, and friendship, but the nights were a different story. The darkness brought out an evil in everyone. It was a place of bullying, domination, and abuse. One night, I was forced into sex by a senior. It was a disgusting and painful experience that I felt helpless to stop. I learned to survive by becoming what I feared.
            </p>
            <blockquote class="pull-quote">
                "Slowly what I was scared of, what I was running from, what I hated, became me. I learned and adopted. I became everything. Abuser, lier, thief, bully, fighter, protector... It was a game of survival."
            </blockquote>

            <h3>The Descent and the Awakening</h3>
            <p>
                This path reached its tragic climax when a close friend died of a drug overdose while we were together. I, along with five others, was sent to a jail cell. It was there, abandoned and at rock bottom, that the desire for true change finally took root. A ten-day Vipassana meditation course became my lifeline. In the silence, I found a way to heal, to forgive, and to listen to the voice I had ignored for so long.
            </p>
            <blockquote class="pull-quote">
                "Something pierced my whole body. I felt nothing, like my body had disappeared... it felt more like dissolving into nature... That moment there I changed. It touched my soul. I flew with nature, I became nature."
            </blockquote>

            <h3>The Birth of a Vision</h3>
            <p>
                This awakening set me on a new course. I traveled, worked on farms, in trucks, and in schools, from the roads of India to the villages of Cambodia. Through these experiences, all the threads of my life came together. I realized I was not meant to just heal myself; I was meant to help heal the system. In 2019, as the world shut down with COVID, I knew it was time to build. On a small plot of family land, with a few friends and a powerful vision, The Joon Project—and now, the Hunate Movement—was born.
