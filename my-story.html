            <h3>Chapter 1: Born in a Village of Rebels</h3>
            <p>
                My parents' union was an act of rebellion against the caste system, a legacy of questioning that was passed down to me before I could even speak. I was born in an animal shelter in Bastim, Bhojpur, a humble beginning that taught me from my first breath that life is raw, earthy, and deeply interconnected. With my parents often away fighting for their political ideals in the communist movement, my early life was shaped by the rhythms of the village and the quiet wisdom of my grandparents.
            </p>

            <blockquote class="pull-quote">
                "This journey of my parents, questioning and exploring new ways to life, was engraved in their whole presence. And that's where I was born with their union."
            </blockquote>

            <h3>Chapter 2: The Crucible of Hostel Life</h3>
            <p>
                Sent away to boarding school, I learned about the world not from books, but from the unspoken hierarchies and hidden alliances of the dormitory. It was here, in places like Suryodaya English Medium School and Peace Land Hostel, that I first witnessed the stark inequalities of our society, the pain of bullying, and the profound strength of friendship forged in shared struggle. I was a product of my environment—learning to be a fighter and a protector, but also an abuser and a thief. It was a game of survival that sharpened my senses and my resolve.
            </p>

            <h3>Chapter 3: The Descent and the Awakening</h3>
            <p>
                Returning to a world I no longer recognized, I fell into a cycle of rebellion, anger, and addiction. I was lost, with no place in society, no purpose, and no family to ground me. This was a period of deep darkness, a journey into the heart of the failing system I had always questioned. The tragic overdose of a dear friend, and my own subsequent time in a jail cell where even my parents wouldn't visit, was the rock bottom that forced me to confront my own destruction and seek a new path.
            </p>
             <blockquote class="pull-quote">
                "When I came out of jail, tears rolled down in silence. I felt what freedom means. I wanted change."
            </blockquote>
            <p>
                A ten-day Vipassana meditation course became my lifeline. In the silence, I found a way to heal, to forgive, and to listen to the voice I had ignored for so long. It was not an escape; it was a homecoming to myself.
            </p>

            <h3>Chapter 4: The Birth of a Vision</h3>
            <p>
                With a healed heart and a clear mind, the questions of my childhood returned with a new urgency. I traveled, worked on farms, in trucks, and in schools, from the roads of India to the villages of Cambodia. I saw that the problems were the same everywhere. The vision for The Joon Project, and later HUNATE, was born from this clarity. It was a vow to stop just questioning the broken world and to start building the one I knew was possible—a world of balance, of community, of purpose. The journey of the seeker had ended, and the journey of the builder had begun.
