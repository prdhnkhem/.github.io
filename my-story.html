            <h3>The Legacy of Rebels</h3>
            <p>
                My story begins before I was born, in the hills of Bhojpur, with my parents. My father, from a Newar family, and my mother, from a Brahmin family, decided to marry against the rigid caste structures of the time. Their union was not just one of love, but an act of revolution. Both were deeply involved in the communist movement, traveling from village to village, spreading a message of change and equality. They built schools and water systems, teaching and working for the community.
            </p>
            <blockquote class="pull-quote">
                "This whole journey of my parents, questioning, and exploring new ways to life was engraved in their whole presence... And that's where I was born with their union."
            </blockquote>

            <h3>A Childhood in the Village</h3>
            <p>
                I was born on November 13th in an animal shelter in Bastim, a common practice in a time and place where life was raw and deeply connected to the earth. My grandmother, a strong and respected leader in our village, was the house administrator. Yet, this stability shattered when a rumor about my father led to a second wife entering our family. The trust was broken. My mother, with my newborn brother on her back, left for the city of Damak, leaving me behind in the care of my grandparents. I grew up wild and free, without the direct guidance of my parents.
            </p>
            <p>
                My first true memory is of waking up alone in a dark room, drawn by the distant sound of celebration. I crawled from my bed, down the wooden stairs, and toward the light of the main door, my vision blurred by tears. There, I saw my entire community—dancing, singing, celebrating together. That journey from darkness to light became a metaphor for my life.
            </p>

            <h3>The Shock of a New World</h3>
            <p>
                Eventually, my mother called for me. The journey to Damak was a violent transition from my known world. I remember being dragged, crying, not wanting to leave my home. Then came the shock of the airport—the sight of an airplane, a marvel of technology I couldn't comprehend, and the strange, clean beauty of the air hostesses who seemed like beings from another world. Damak was a different universe of concrete, bicycles, and electricity. My four-year-old world had flipped, and I was a wild spirit trying to make sense of it all.
            </p>

            <h3>Forged in the Hostel's Fire</h3>
            <p>
                After a brief period with my reunited family, my parents found me too difficult to handle and sent me to Peace Land Hostel. For the next eleven years, this institution became my world. It was a place of deep contradictions. I was surrounded by the children of wealthy British Army officers, with their toys and stories of vacations, which filled me with a sense of lack and jealousy.
            </p>
            <p>
                The days were filled with school, sports, and friendship, but the nights were a different story. The darkness brought out an evil in everyone. It was a place of bullying, domination, and abuse. One night, I was forced into sex by a senior. It was a disgusting and painful experience that I felt helpless to stop. I learned to survive by becoming what I feared.
            </p>
            <blockquote class="pull-quote">
                "Slowly what I was scared of, what I was running from, what I hated, became me. I learned and adopted. I became everything. Abuser, lier, thief, bully, fighter, protector... It was a game of survival."
            </blockquote>

            <h3>The Chaos of Freedom</h3>
            <p>
                When the hostel finally closed, I returned home, but I was no longer the boy who had left. I was filled with a greed born from years of scarcity. I started stealing money from my family, buying the things I felt I had been denied. My relationship with my parents, especially my father, became explosive. He discovered my private journal and beat me for the thoughts and explorations I had written. In a moment of rage, I burned every journal I had. Another time, my brother betrayed me over a petty argument, telling my father I was smoking. My father dragged me into the street and beat me publicly with a water pipe. The pain of the betrayal was worse than the physical blows.
            </p>
            
            <h3>A Shift to the Capital</h3>
            <p>
                To change my environment, I was sent to Kathmandu to finish my studies. It was a different kind of chaos, a school full of rebels and misfits like myself. I found a new community and even excelled academically, but the pattern of rebellion continued with gang fights and bunking school. It was a period of healing in some ways, more organized than the wildness of Damak, but I was still adrift.
            </p>

            <h3>The Descent</h3>
            <p>
                After returning to Damak, my dream of joining the British Army—a path many of my friends had taken—ended in failure. I felt hopeless. I gave up on my studies and dove headfirst into a life of drugs and aimlessness. I was an addict, lying and stealing to fuel my habit. This dark journey reached its tragic climax when a close friend died of a drug overdose while we were all together. I, along with five others, was sent to jail.
            </p>
            <blockquote class="pull-quote">
                "When I was in jail, my parents didn't come to see me. They sent a message that I was better there, and it broke me... When I came out, tears rolled down in silence. I felt what freedom means. I felt for my parents too... I wanted change."
            </blockquote>

            <h3>The Awakening</h3>
            <p>
                This was my rock bottom. It was the turning point. I decided to change, and I found my path through yoga, meditation, and a deep study of the world's conspiracies and failing systems. I went to a Vipassana meditation retreat. In the ten days of silence, something inside me broke open. While staring at a sunset, a profound experience washed over me.
            </p>
             <blockquote class="pull-quote">
                "Something pierced my whole body. I felt nothing, like my body had disappeared... It was not a cry of pain or sorrow... it felt more like dissolving into nature... That moment there I changed. Something inside me changed. It touched my soul. I flew with nature, I became nature."
            </blockquote>
            <p>
                This awakening set me on a new course. I began working as a laborer on my mother's trucks, traveling across Nepal. I saw our country from the ground up—the corruption of the police, the lives of people on the road, the beauty of our land. I hitchhiked to India, seeking knowledge at Patanjali Yogpeeth, determined to learn the science of life.
            </p>

            <h3>The Birth of a Vision</h3>
            <p>
                My journey of learning took me to Maya Universe Academy, a volunteer-run school in Nepal. There, surrounded by international travelers, curious children, and a culture of creation, I found a place where I could express all parts of myself. I taught, I built, I danced, I healed. I traveled to Cambodia, volunteering on a permaculture farm and seeing the ocean for the first time. I became a principal at a branch of Maya, redesigning the school system to empower children with real-world skills and responsibilities.
            </p>
            <p>
                Through these experiences, all the threads of my life—the rebellion of my parents, the self-reliance of the hostel, the pain of addiction, the peace of meditation, and the wisdom of the road—came together. I realized I was not meant to just heal myself; I was meant to help heal the system. In 2019, as the world shut down with COVID, I knew it was time to build. On a small plot of family land, with a few friends and a powerful vision, The Joon Project—and now, the Hunate Movement—was born.
