            <p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic; font-size: 1.1em;">This is my story, as I remember it. It is a journey of breaking and healing, of losing a path and finding a purpose. It is the soil from which the Hunate Movement has grown.</p>

            <h3>Chapter 1: Born in a Village of Rebels</h3>
            <p>
                <!-- **ACTION: Replace this placeholder text with the actual content from your document.** -->
                My parents were from Bhojpur, a place where stories are carried on the wind. Their union was an act of rebellion against the caste system, a legacy of questioning that was passed down to me before I could even speak. I was born in an animal shelter, a humble beginning that taught me from my first breath that life is raw, earthy, and deeply interconnected...

            <h3>Chapter 2: The Crucible of Hostel Life</h3>
            <p>
                <!-- **ACTION: Replace this placeholder text with the actual content from your document.** -->
                Sent away to boarding school, I learned about the world not from books, but from the unspoken hierarchies and hidden alliances of the dormitory. It was here I first witnessed the stark inequalities of our society, the pain of bullying, and the profound strength of friendship forged in shared struggle. This was the crucible that sharpened my senses and my resolve...

            <h3>Chapter 3: The Descent and the Awakening</h3>
            <p>
                <!-- **ACTION: Replace this placeholder text with the actual content from your document.** -->
                Returning to a world I no longer recognized, I fell into a cycle of rebellion and addiction. It was a period of deep darkness, a journey into the heart of the failing system I had always questioned. The loss of a dear friend was the tragic turning point that forced me to confront my own destruction and seek a new path. My first Vipassana retreat was not an escape; it was a homecoming to myself...

            <h3>Chapter 4: The Birth of a Vision</h3>
            <p>
                <!-- **ACTION: Replace this placeholder text with the actual content from your document.** -->
                With a healed heart and a clear mind, the questions of my childhood returned with new urgency. The vision for The Joon Project, and later HUNATE, was born from this clarity. It was a vow to build the world I knew was possible—a world of balance, of community, of purpose. The journey of the seeker had ended, and the journey of the builder had begun...
