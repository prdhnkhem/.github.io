                <h2>I. The Forging of a Question (1991 - 2013)</h2>
                <p class="section-intro" style="text-align: left; margin: 1rem 0 2rem 0;">My life began as a question. I was born in the hills of Bhojpur to parents who had already committed an act of revolution by defying the caste system to marry. Their spirit of rebellion was the backdrop to my life, but their external fight was mirrored by an internal chaos that defined my childhood. Sent away to a hostel at a young age, I was severed from the very concepts of family and home. I became an outsider, a silent observer of a world I didn't feel a part of.</p>
                <p>This feeling of being lost became my reality. As a teenager, I was a perfect product of the failing system I now critique. I was lost, angry, and drowning in addiction, chasing the ghosts of validation that society offers. I tried every path I was told would lead to success—I trained for the British Army and failed; I enrolled in multiple colleges and quit. I was looking for a purpose in a world that only valued profit, and the more I searched, the more I unraveled.</p>
                <p>The system is designed to keep us running. It offers no space for silence, no time for reflection. I was running from myself, and the breaking point came in the most brutal way imaginable. A close friend died of a drug overdose while we were together. The aftermath landed me in a jail cell. In that cold, quiet room, the running stopped. I was forced to confront the truth of where my path had led.</p>
                
                <div class="callout">
                    <p>"While in jail, my parents sent a message that I was better off where I was. That message broke me, but it also set me free. In that moment of absolute abandonment, I understood that no one was coming to save me. My liberation was my own responsibility."</p>

                <hr class="section-divider" style="margin: 4rem auto;">

                <h2>II. The Fire of Transformation (2013 - 2019)</h2>
                <p>That moment was the end of one life and the true beginning of another. I walked out of that jail and straight into a 10-day Vipassana meditation course. For ten days, I sat in silence. I did not fight my pain; I observed it. I watched the waves of anger, grief, and shame rise and fall like the breath. And in that profound stillness, a clarity I had never known began to emerge. I made a new vow: to stop being a victim of the system and to dedicate my life to building the alternative.</p>
                <p>My real education began on the road. I became a student of life, not of institutions. I worked as a laborer on trucks, traveling across Nepal and India, listening to the unfiltered stories of drivers, farmers, and prostitutes. I volunteered on organic farms in Cambodia and became the principal of a remote school. I was no longer running *from* something; I was searching *for* the foundational principles of a healthier way of life.</p>

                <hr class="section-divider" style="margin: 4rem auto;">

                <h2>III. The Joon Project: An Experiment in Freedom (2019 - 2023)</h2>
                <p>The vision for a new way of living needed a home, a place to be tested against reality. In 2019, as the world locked down in fear, we decided to build. On a piece of family land that was nothing more than a rice paddy—a place that seemed like "nowhere"—The Joon Project was born.</p>
                <p>We started with nothing but a shared belief that we could create with what we had. We built our first hut from mud and bamboo. We hosted free music sessions that united local youth. We partnered with an orphanage, not as charity workers, but as family, introducing practices of self-responsibility and healing.</p>

                <div class="callout">
                    <p>"The Joon Camp Festival was a revolution of hearts. No tickets, no sponsors. Just people sharing their skills, their food, and their spirit. It was the living proof that the best things in life are not transactions; they are gifts."</p>
                </div>

                <p>Joon was our laboratory. It was raw, imperfect, and beautiful. It taught me that community is not a place you find, but a practice you build. In 2023, life intervened. A co-founder's father had a terrible accident, and the project stopped. The pause was painful, but it was also a necessary teacher. It forced me to reflect and ask a deeper question: How could this small, radical experiment become a blueprint for the world?</p>
