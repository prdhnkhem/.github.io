                        <ul>
                            <li>We will partner with <strong>7 dedicated families</strong> who have land and a deep desire for a self-sufficient life.</li>
                            <li>We will partner with <strong>7 forward-thinking orphanages</strong> to help them become true homes of healing, growth, and resilience.</li>
                            <li>We will establish these 14 "Hunateculture Hubs" across the <strong>7 provinces of Nepal</strong>.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Over a five-year period, our team of Hunate Engineers will guide each hub through a complete life redesign. They will become lighthouses in their communities—fully self-reliant in food, water, and energy, operating ethical family businesses, and serving as living classrooms for their neighbors to learn from.</p>
