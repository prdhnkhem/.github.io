                            <p>This is a conscious ethical choice. We believe the NGO system often creates dependency and is prone to corruption. By remaining an independent, citizen-led movement, we maintain our agility and integrity. Our trust is built on radical transparency, not government paperwork. You can see all our financials live on our Support Us page.</p>

                            <p>No. The core team operates on a principle of shared investment and selfless service (seva). We are not building jobs; we are building a new world. Basic costs for food, travel, and accommodation during project work are covered by our operational funds, but this is a path of purpose, not profit.</p>
