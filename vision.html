                <p>A blueprint for a regenerative future, built on the balance of Humanity, Nature, and Technology.</p>

                <h2>What is HUNATE?</h2>
                <p>HUNATE is the evolution of the lessons learned from my life and The Joon Project. It is a philosophy and a system for redesigning our world from the inside out. The name itself is our formula:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>HU:</strong> Humanity – Reconnecting with our true potential, wisdom, and purpose.</li>
                    <li><strong>NA:</strong> Nature – Restoring our sacred relationship with the Earth and its ecosystems.</li>
                    <li><strong>TE:</strong> Technology – Realigning our tools to serve life, not destroy it.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>The Problem: A World Out of Balance</h2>
                <p>We live in a failing social system. Our education creates dependency, our healthcare profits from sickness, our economy thrives on destruction, and our culture distracts us from what truly matters. We are disconnected from ourselves, from each other, and from the planet. HUNATE exists to address this root crisis.</p>

                <h2>The Solution: Hunateculture</h2>
                <p>Hunateculture is our practical life design system. It is a culture of the future, rooted in the past. We weave together the timeless wisdom of ancient sciences with modern, ethical innovation to create holistic and self-sufficient lives. Our core tools include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Vedic Astrology & Vastu Shastra:</strong> To align our lives and spaces with cosmic and earthly energies.</li>
                    <li><strong>Ayurveda & Yoga:</strong> To cultivate physical, mental, and spiritual well-being.</li>
                    <li><strong>Permaculture & Eco-Architecture:</strong> To design regenerative farms and natural homes.</li>
                    <li><strong>Ethical Technology & Business:</strong> To build sustainable livelihoods that heal, rather than harm.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h2>The Mission: The 7-7-7 Initiative</h2>
                <p>Our first mission is a bold, on-the-ground plan to prove this model can work. The 7-7-7 Initiative will:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Partner with <strong>7 families</strong> and <strong>7 orphanages</strong>...</li>
                    <li>...across the <strong>7 provinces of Nepal</strong>...</li>
                    <li>...to transform them into fully self-sufficient, regenerative "Hunateculture Hubs."</li>
                </ul>
                <p>These 14 hubs will become living classrooms and lighthouses of hope for their communities, demonstrating a tangible alternative to the current system.</p>

                <h2>Who We Are: Engineers & Mentors</h2>
                <p>This movement is not built by one person, but by a dedicated team. We are actively recruiting a core team of <strong>Hunate Engineers</strong>—young, multi-skilled life designers under 30. They will be guided by a council of <strong>Hunate Mentors</strong>—respected elders and professionals who provide wisdom and ethical oversight.</p>
                
                <h2>This is a Call to Action</h2>
                <p>HUNATE is more than a project; it is a movement of citizens who are tired of waiting for permission to build a better world. It is a declaration that we have the power to heal ourselves and our planet. If this vision resonates with your soul, we invite you to join us.</p>
