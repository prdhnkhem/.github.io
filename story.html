                <h3 class="story-phase-subtitle">(1991 - 2019) The Forging of a Visionary</h3>

                    <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/800x400.png?text=Childhood+in+Bhojpur" alt="A depiction of rural life in Bhojpur, Nepal.">
                </div>

                <p>The story of HUNATE begins not with a plan, but with a question. Born in the remote hills of Bhojpur to revolutionary parents who defied the caste system, my life was shaped by a legacy of rebellion. But their fight for a better world externally was mirrored by a fractured world at home. Sent to a hostel at a young age, I was disconnected from family, community, and myself.</p>

                <p>This disconnection festered. By my late teens, I was lost—navigating addiction, stealing to fit in, and chasing a future I didn't believe in. The modern education system felt like a cage, teaching obedience but not purpose. My journey led me to the army, to multiple colleges, and deeper into a cycle of confusion and self-destruction. The turning point came with the ultimate loss: a friend died of a drug overdose while I was with him. The incident, and the jail time that followed, shattered my world and broke me open.</p>

                <div class="callout">
                    <p>"My parents sent a message that I was better there in jail, and it broke me... I felt what freedom means. I wanted change."</p>
                </div>

                <p>This rock bottom became my foundation. I decided to change. I walked away from the life I knew and into a 10-day Vipassana meditation course. In the profound silence, I confronted my pain, my anger, and my grief. I didn't just find peace; I found myself. I cleansed myself from the inside out and emerged with a new vow: to understand the root of our collective suffering and to find a real, tangible way to heal.</p>

                <p>My education began on the road. I worked as a laborer on trucks, traveling across Nepal and India. I listened to the stories of drivers, farmers, and prostitutes. I saw the corruption, the pollution, and the quiet dignity of people surviving within a broken system. I hitchhiked, volunteered on organic farms in Cambodia, and became the principal of a remote school, all in search of an answer. I was no longer running from something; I was running towards a new way of living.</p>

                <h2 class="section-title">Phase 2: The Joon Project</h2>
                <h3 class="story-phase-subtitle">(2019 - 2023) Building a Dream from the Ground Up</h3>

                </div>

                <p>The Joon Project was the first attempt to give this vision a home. As the COVID-19 pandemic froze the world, it became a call to action. With a group of friends in my hometown of Damak, we started with nothing but a piece of family land and donated tools. We built our first hut from mud, bamboo, and community spirit. This "place that seemed like nowhere" became our laboratory.</p>

                <p>We lived by a simple rule: create with what you have. We built our own water systems, shelters, and even an organic, door-less toilet. When a storm destroyed our tent, we rebuilt it the next day, stronger and with more laughter. The project was never just about structures; it was about connection. We hosted free live music sessions that united local youth, and we partnered with a local orphanage, not just to help, but to become family—introducing yoga, meditation, and a system of self-responsibility that we called "The Joon Way."</p>

                <div class="callout">
                    <p>"The Joon Camp Festival was a revolution of hearts. We didn’t sell tickets. We didn’t ask for sponsors. Still... everything happened. When people come together with the right intention, magic unfolds."</p>
                </div>

                <p>For several years, The Joon Project thrived as an international hub, welcoming volunteers from around the world. We shared skills, stories, and cultures, experimenting with a life less dependent on money and more on mutual trust. But in 2023, the project came to an abrupt halt when a co-founder's father suffered a severe accident. The community's energy shifted entirely to his care. It was a painful, necessary pause that forced a deep reflection.</p>

                <h2 class="section-title">Phase 3: The Birth of HUNATE</h2>
                <h3 class="story-phase-subtitle">(2023 - Present) From an Experiment to a Blueprint</h3>

                <div class="story-image">

                </div>

                <p>The halt of The Joon Project was not an end, but a transformation. It was a time to distill the raw, passionate experimentation of Joon into a mature, strategic, and scalable vision. I realized that while Joon (meaning "Moon") was about starting fresh, the next phase needed to be about returning to the community with a clear blueprint for healing.</p>

                <p>This is HUNATE. It carries all the lessons from my personal journey and the hands-on experience of The Joon Project. It is the synthesis of ancient wisdom and modern ethics, designed not just to create one isolated community, but to provide a replicable system—Hunateculture—that any family, orphanage, or community can use to reclaim their health, purpose, and sovereignty.</p>

                <p>My story is not unique. It is the story of a generation feeling lost in a system that no longer serves us. HUNATE is the response. It is a vow to stop just talking about the problems and to start building the solution, one family, one village, one act of courage at a time.</p>
