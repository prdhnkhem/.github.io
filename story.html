                <h3 class="story-phase-subtitle" style="color: var(--himal-stone); font-size: 1.5rem; text-align: center; margin-top: -1rem; margin-bottom: 3rem;">(1991 - 2013) A Journey Through the Cage</h3>

                <p>My life began with a question. I was born in the hills of Bhojpur to parents who had already rebelled against the system by defying the rules of caste. But their external revolution was a mirror to our internal chaos. Sent away to a hostel, I spent my childhood feeling like an outsider, disconnected from the very ideas of family and home.</p>

                <p>This feeling of being lost became a way of life. By my late teens, I was a product of the failing system I now speak of—addicted, angry, and chasing ghosts. I tried everything the world told me would bring success: I trained for the British Army and failed. I enrolled in multiple colleges and quit. I was looking for a purpose in a world that only offered profit. The deeper I looked, the more lost I became.</p>
                
                <p>The breaking point came in the darkest way possible. A close friend died of a drug overdose while we were together. The aftermath landed me in a jail cell, a place where I finally had to confront the truth of the path I was on.</p>

                <div class="callout" style="border-left-color: var(--prana-red); color: var(--manjusha-sand);">
                    <p>"My parents sent a message that I was better off in jail. That message broke me, but it also set me free. In that moment, I understood that no one was coming to save me. I had to save myself."</p>
                </div>

                <p>That moment was the end of one life and the beginning of another. I walked out of that jail and straight into a 10-day Vipassana meditation course. For ten days, I sat in silence. I did not run from my pain; I observed it. I watched the anger, the grief, and the shame rise and fall like the breath. And in that silence, I found a clarity I had never known. I made a new vow: to stop being a victim of the system and to start building the alternative.</p>

                <h3 class="story-phase-subtitle" style="color: var(--himal-stone); font-size: 1.5rem; text-align: center; margin-top: -1rem; margin-bottom: 3rem;">(2019 - 2023) An Experiment in Freedom</h3>

                <p>My real education began. I traveled, not as a tourist, but as a student of life. I worked on trucks, volunteered on farms, and listened to the stories of those forgotten by society. The vision for a new way of living began to take shape, and in 2019, it found its first home: The Joon Project.</p>

                <p>As the world shut down for a pandemic, we opened up. On a piece of family land that was "nowhere," a group of friends and I started to build. We had no money, no permission, and no grand plan—only a shared belief that we could create with what we had. We built our first hut from mud and bamboo. We hosted free music sessions for local youth. We partnered with an orphanage, not as charity workers, but as family.</p>
                
                <div class="callout" style="border-left-color: var(--prana-red); color: var(--manjusha-sand);">
                    <p>"The Joon Camp Festival was a revolution of hearts. No tickets, no sponsors. Just people sharing their skills, their food, and their spirit. It was proof that the best things in life are not transactions; they are gifts."</p>
                </div>

                <p>Joon was our laboratory. It was raw, imperfect, and beautiful. It taught me that community is not a place, but a practice. But in 2023, life intervened. A co-founder's father had a terrible accident, and the project stopped. The pause was painful, but it was also a necessary teacher. It forced me to reflect on what we had learned and to ask a deeper question: How could this small experiment become a blueprint for the world?</p>

                <p>The end of Joon was the beginning of HUNATE. It was time to distill the lessons from my life's journey—from the pain and the silence to the mud and the music—into a clear, replicable system that anyone could use.</p>
                
                <p>My story is the "why" behind this work. It is the proof that transformation is possible. Now that you have heard my story, I invite you to understand the philosophy that it gave birth to.</p>
