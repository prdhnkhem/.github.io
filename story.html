                <h2>I. The Forging of a Question (1991 - 2013)</h2>
                <p>My life began as a question. Born in the hills of Bhojpur to parents who committed their own revolution by defying the caste system to marry, I inherited a spirit of rebellion. But their external fight was mirrored by an internal chaos that defined my childhood. Sent away to a hostel at a young age, I was severed from the concepts of family and home. I became an outsider, a silent observer.</p>
                <p>This feeling of being lost became my reality. As a teenager, I was a perfect product of the failing system I now critique—angry, addicted, and chasing the ghosts of validation. I tried every prescribed path to "success"—I trained for the British Army and failed; I enrolled in six different colleges and quit them all. I was searching for purpose in a world that only valued profit.</p>
                <p>The breaking point was absolute. A close friend died of a drug overdose while we were together. The aftermath landed me in a jail cell. In that cold silence, the running stopped. I was forced to confront the truth of where my path had led. While in jail, my parents sent a message that I was better off where I was. It broke me, but it also set me free. In that moment of absolute abandonment, I understood that no one was coming to save me. My liberation was my own responsibility.</p>

                <h2>II. The Fire of Transformation (2013 - 2019)</h2>
                <p>I walked out of that jail and into a 10-day Vipassana meditation course. For ten days, I sat in silence. I did not fight my pain; I observed it. In that stillness, a clarity I had never known emerged. I made a new vow: to stop being a victim of the system and dedicate my life to building the alternative.</p>
                <p>My real education began on the road. I became a student of life, not institutions. I worked as a laborer on trucks across Nepal and India, listening to the unfiltered stories of those on the margins. I hitchhiked to ashrams, volunteered on an organic farm in Cambodia, and became the principal of a remote school. I was no longer running *from* something; I was searching *for* the foundational principles of a healthier way to live.</p>

                <h2>III. The Joon Project: A Laboratory for a New World (2019 - 2023)</h2>
                <p>The vision needed a home. In 2019, as the world locked down in fear, we started to build. On a piece of family land that was just a rice paddy—a place that seemed like "nowhere"—The Joon Project was born. We started with nothing but a shared belief that we could create with what we had. We built our first hut from mud and bamboo. We hosted free music festivals that united local youth. We partnered with an orphanage, not as charity workers, but as family.</p>
                <p>Joon was our laboratory. It was raw, imperfect, and beautiful. It taught me that community is a practice you build daily. In 2023, life intervened. A co-founder's father had a terrible accident, and the project had to stop. The pause was painful, but it forced me to ask a deeper question: How could this small, radical experiment become a blueprint for the world?</p>
